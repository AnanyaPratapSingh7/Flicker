# Paradyze2 Tech Stack

This document outlines the technology stack for Paradyze2, our unified crypto financial hub. It covers the primary tools and technologies used across the frontend, backend, and supporting infrastructure.

---

## 1. Overview

Paradyze2 is designed as a modular, single-page application (SPA) that aggregates multiple crypto financial modules into one central hub. The goal is to create a seamless, high-performance user experience while supporting independent module rollouts via feature flags.

## 2. Frontend

### 2.1 Framework & Library
- **React**: Core library for building the user interface.
- **React Router**: For client-side routing, enabling smooth navigation between modules.
- **React Context API / Redux (TBD)**: For global state management across modules.
- **React Query / SWR**: For efficient data fetching, caching, and revalidation.

### 2.2 Styling & UI
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development with a consistent design system.
- **CSS Modules**: For scoped component-level styling if needed.
- **Glassmorphism Design**: Emphasis on modern, minimalistic UI with glass-like effects and subtle haptic border effects.

### 2.3 Build Tools & Bundlers
- **Webpack / Vite**: For module bundling and fast development experience.
- **Babel**: To transpile modern JavaScript/TypeScript code for broader browser support.

### 2.4 Testing
- **Jest**: For unit testing React components and utility functions.
- **React Testing Library**: For component integration testing.
- **Cypress**: For end-to-end (E2E) testing to ensure smooth user flows.

## 3. Backend

### 3.1 Languages & Frameworks
- **TypeScript (Node.js)**: Main language for building backend services for most modules.
  - **Express / Fastify**: Potential frameworks for building RESTful or GraphQL APIs.
- **Python**: Dedicated to the Agent Launchpad module.
  - **Flask / FastAPI**: Framework options for creating Python-based microservices.

### 3.2 Blockchain & Crypto Integration
- **Injective SDK**: For interacting with the Injective Exchange and other crypto functionalities.
- **Cosmos SDK & Smart Contracts**: To handle blockchain interactions with Cosmos-based assets.
- **Chain Abstraction Layer**: Custom implementations or third-party libraries for seamless cross-chain integration.

### 3.3 Data Storage & Caching
- **PostgreSQL / MongoDB**: For persistent data storage.
- **Redis**: For caching and real-time data management.

---

## 4. Infrastructure & DevOps

### 4.1 Repository Structure
- **Monorepo Approach**: Single repository to manage shared code, module separation, and centralized CI/CD pipelines.
- **Feature Flags**: Integrated system to enable/disable modules independently.

### 4.2 CI/CD & Deployment
- **GitHub Actions / GitLab CI**: For automated builds, tests, and deployments.
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
- **Kubernetes / Docker Compose**: For orchestrating containers in production.
- **Vercel / Netlify**: For deploying the frontend SPA.

### 4.3 Monitoring & Logging
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: For real-time performance monitoring and analytics.
- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**: For centralized logging and troubleshooting.
- **Sentry**: For error monitoring and alerting.

---

## 5. Security

- **TLS/SSL Encryption**: For secure communication between client and server.
- **OWASP Guidelines**: Adherence to industry-standard security practices.
- **Regular Penetration Testing**: To identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
- **Dependency Audits**: Automated tools (e.g., npm audit, Snyk) for ongoing security checks.

---

## 6. Collaboration & Documentation

- **Confluence / Notion**: For documentation, meeting notes, and collaborative project planning.
- **Slack / Discord**: For team communication and community feedback.
